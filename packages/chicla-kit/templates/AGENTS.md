# AGENTS.md — instructions for coding agents (not only Claude)

Written by `chicla init`. The full rules are in `CLAUDE.md`: read it first; it applies to you whatever agent you are. The essentials:

1. **Start:** read `CHICLA_PROJECT_STATUS-N.md`, then run `chicla bump-round --verify` and `chicla check-manifest`. If one fails, stop and report. List the open decisions with your suggestion and wait for the owner.
2. **Emergency:** if the owner writes `/dump`, run `chicla dump` at once and hand over the zip, with no questions. To restore one: `chicla recovery <dump.zip>`.
3. **Work:** one small task per round; tests first and watch them fail; check dangerous behaviour with something other than the code that did it.
4. **Never leaves the machine:** `.env` and `.env.*`, private keys, credentials, `node_modules/`, caches. Do not put them in a zip or in a conversation.
5. **Be honest:** say what you did not run; never mark a gate done (they are the owner's); report what you notice outside the task instead of fixing it silently.
6. **Close:** `chicla bump-round`, then `chicla make-delivery <out.zip> --against <previous.zip>` and `chicla verify-delivery <out.zip> --against <previous.zip>`.
